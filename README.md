# Translation Transformer

## Overview
Translation Transformer is a neural network model designed to perform high-quality machine translation between multiple languages. Built upon the Transformer architecture, this project leverages advanced attention mechanisms and parallel processing capabilities to provide efficient and accurate translations.

## Features
- **Attention Mechanism**: Utilizes self-attention and multi-head attention to capture long-range dependencies in sentences.
- **Positional Encoding**: Incorporates positional information to understand the order of words in a sentence.
- **Scalability**: Supports training on large datasets and can be scaled up with more layers and attention heads.
- **Multi-language Support**: Capable of translating text between multiple language pairs.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Includes access to pre-trained models for quick deployment and testing.
- **Custom Training**: Allows fine-tuning on custom datasets to improve translation quality for specific domains.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Implements BLEU and other evaluation metrics to measure translation performance.

## Installation
To install the dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
